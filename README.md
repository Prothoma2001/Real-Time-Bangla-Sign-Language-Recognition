# Real-Time-Bangla-Sign-Language-Recognition
We developed a model for Bangla Continuous Sign Language Recognition (BCSLR) using CNN and Hand Landmarks. Due to the dearth of gestures videos for Bangla words, we also built our own large dataset, that consists of 5100 videos of 20 different person's gestures of 100 Bangla words in 5 different backgrounds (indoor and outdoor) and lighting. We divided our 70\% dataset as training data and rest 30\% as our testing data.
